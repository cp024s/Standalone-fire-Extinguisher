## Features

- Early detection of fire through various sensors.
- Quick and automated fire suppression using a fire extinguisher.
- Real-time alerts and notifications.
- Configurable settings for different environments and fire types.
- Integration with IoT platforms for remote monitoring.

## Components

To replicate this project, you'll need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Fire detection sensors (e.g., smoke and heat sensors)
- Fire extinguisher
- Solenoid valve for extinguisher actuation
- Relay modules
- Buzzer or alarm system
- IoT module (optional)
- Power supply
- Enclosure for safety and protection

## Installation

1. **Arduino IDE**: Install the Arduino IDE on your computer if you haven't already.

2. **Libraries**: Install any required libraries by going to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries" in the Arduino IDE.

3. **Hardware Assembly**: Assemble the hardware components following the project's wiring diagrams and instructions. Ensure that all connections are secure and functional.

4. **Software Configuration**: Upload the Arduino sketch (`fire_extinguisher.ino`) to your Arduino board. Customize the configuration variables in the code to match your specific setup and requirements.

5. **Testing**: Safely test the system by simulating fire conditions and verifying the response of the extinguisher and sensors.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Install the Standalone Fire Extinguisher in areas where fire hazards are a concern, such as kitchens, workshops, or server rooms.

2. **Fire Detection**: The system continuously monitors for signs of fire using smoke and heat sensors.

3. **Alerts**: When a fire is detected, the system triggers an alert, which may include alarms, notifications, or IoT platform integration for remote alerts.

4. **Extinguisher Activation**: If configured, the system activates the solenoid valve to release the fire extinguisher's contents to suppress the fire.

5. **Manual Control**: Depending on your setup, you may have manual control options to activate the extinguisher remotely.

6. **Monitoring**: Regularly check the system's status and sensors to ensure they are functioning correctly.
